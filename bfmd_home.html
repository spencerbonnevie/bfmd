		<h2>Title of article</h2>
		<p>Hotline Miami 2 takes place in a heavily anachronic order before and after the events of the original, focusing more on the latter between October and December 1991. During the events of Hotline Miami, the player's character, "Jacket," is unwittingly manipulated into killing off the leadership of the Russian Mob by 50 Blessings, a neo-nationalist terror cell that masquerades as a peaceful activist group. The persona of "Richard", a mysterious figure in a rooster mask that occasionally appeared to Jacket in the original game, appears at different points to the game's playable characters.[7] The player controls these individuals in a series of intersecting plotlines exploring both the background and the aftermath of Jacket's rampage.

		After his rampage, Jacket has been arrested and brought to trial. He has gained national notoriety; the game's tutorial level takes place in a slasher film adaptation depicting him as "The Pig Butcher." The film's star, Martin Brown, is a sociopath who relishes being able to act out his violent fantasies during filming. Martin dies early in the game when accidentally shot with real ammunition on set during the shooting of the film's final scene. A journalist, Evan Wright, is writing a book about Jacket's spree and trying to learn more about the people behind it. Evan is given leads from Manny Pardo, a psychotic police officer who uses his position to go on killing sprees during stakeout operations.

		"The Fans," five thrill-seeking killers who are emulating Jacket's spree, carry out a string of murders against other criminals. Eventually they kill a former henchman of the Russian Mafia, now run by the original boss' son, and when "the Son" attempts to reconnect with said henchman the Fans follow his call to attack his new hideout. The Fans are all killed during this attack; their last survivor, Tony, is personally killed by Pardo to deny him his "fifteen minutes of fame."

		The story of "The Soldier," the convenience store owner from the previous game, shows him fighting a losing war against Russia in Hawaii alongside Jacket prior to the first game's events. The Soldier saves Jacket's life during one of their last missions, but later dies during a nuclear attack on San Francisco, revealing his appearances in the previous game are hallucinations. The game also follows two other 50 Blessings agents from the original game, Jake and Richter. Jake realizes the officially-peaceful 50 Blessings organization is giving him his orders when he meets with one of their representatives, and praises them. If he avoids the fate depicted in the original game, being captured and murdered by the Russian Mafia during a mission, 50 Blessings will kill him anyway to silence him. Richter, the agent who killed Jacket's girlfriend, is revealed to be reluctant to work with 50 Blessings until they threaten his ailing mother. Like Jacket, Richter is captured and imprisoned, but manages to escape.</p>
